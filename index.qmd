## Background

This website showcases the outcomes of a research grant entitled "*Supporting Post Pandemic Recovery and Resilience through New Forms of Data*". The grant was led
by two world leading research groups: the Geospatial Analytics & Monitoring Centre (GAMC), Korea Research Institute for Human Settlements (KRIHS), South Korea and the Geographic Data Science Lab, University of Liverpool, UK (GDSL). The overarching aim of the activities was to extend interactions beyond our core hubs by developing a wider network of participants in both the UK and South Korea. 

As part of the grant, two specific sets of activities have taken place:

1. **UK Workshop, November 2022**: Supporting Post Pandemic Recovery and Resilience through New Forms of Data. 
2. **International Conference, June 2023**: Knowledge Expansion and Exchange.
