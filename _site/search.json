The grant was led by two world leading research groups: the Geospatial Analytics & Monitoring Centre (GAMC), Korea Research Institute for Human Settlements (KRIHS), South Korea and the Geographic Data Science Lab, University of Liverpool, UK (GDSL). The overarching aim of the activities was to extend interactions beyond our core hubs by developing a wider network of participants in both the UK and South Korea.\nAs part of the grant, two specific sets of activities have taken place:\n\nUK Workshop, November 2022: Supporting Post Pandemic Recovery and Resilience through New Forms of Data.\nInternational Conference, June 2023: Knowledge Expansion and Exchange."

Yohan, Jae Soen, Youngmin and Stella were excellent hosts throughout the day. We first visited the Korean Territorial Development Museum, and were given a guided tour comprising an overview of the urban history of Korea, and insights into the Smart City programmes that have been rolled out across the country over the past century.\n    \nFollowing lunch with KRIHS, we were then taken on a guided tour of the historic districts of Seoul, comprising a visit to a traditional Korean palace and a guided tour of Bukchon Hanok Village, which is well known for its traditional Korean housing. On this tour we learned more about the history of Korea, particularly its Royal Family and traditions that remain in place in modern Korean society today. The day finished with a lovely Bibimbap dinner, which was shared between GDSL and KRIHS colleagues."

Sejong is a relatively new city, which was constructed to encourage investment in the country’s central region. On the way to the KRIHS HQ, we got an exciting tour of Sejong, showing how rapidly development is occurring here, and the particular emphasis on Smart City programmes.\nWe arrived at the HQ of KRIHS, which was something to behold, comprising incredible conferencing, co-working and meeting room facilities, rooftop views of Sejong, and even an indoor tennis court and gym for employees. We were given a full tour of the facilities, and reunited with members of KRIHS such as Myung-Hwa and Eunsun who had visited us in Liverpool the last year.\n   \nFollowing an introduction from KRIHS director Sangkeon Lee, we were treated to a lovely Korean lunchbox, and enjoyed conversations and discussions with KRIHS.\n \nThe research exchange then commenced, with talks from GDSL members Francisco, Dani, Carmen, Cillian and Dan, as well as a series of talks from KRIHS members, and other invited talks with speakers from Inha University and the Korean National University of Transportation. The day ended with a traditional Korean dinner and GDSL members returned to Seoul.\nSlides for these talks can be found here."
