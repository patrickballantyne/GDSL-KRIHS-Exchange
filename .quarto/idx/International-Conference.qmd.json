Yohan, Jae Soen, Youngmin and Stella were excellent hosts throughout the day. We first visited the [Korean Territorial Development Museum](), and were given a guided tour comprising an overview of the urban history of Korea, and insights into the Smart City programmes that have been rolled out across the country over the past century.\n\n![](photo2/a1.jpg) ![](photo2/a2.jpg) ![](photo2/a3.jpg) ![](photo2/a9.jpg) ![](photo2/a10.jpg)\n\nFollowing lunch with KRIHS, we were then taken on a guided tour of the historic districts of Seoul, comprising a visit to a traditional Korean palace and a guided tour of [Bukchon Hanok Village](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bukchon+Hanok+Village/@37.5786206,126.9697596,15.37z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x357ca2012d5c39cf:0x7e11eca1405bf29b!2sSeoul,+South+Korea!3b1!8m2!3d37.5518911!4d126.9917937!16zL20vMGhzcWY!3m5!1s0x357ca2daaff8c14f:0xcdbcbaa9ffc9e59a!8m2!3d37.5814696!4d126.9849519!16s%2Fm%2F043pdws?entry=ttu), which is well known for its traditional Korean housing. On this tour we learned more about the history of Korea, particularly its Royal Family and traditions that remain in place in modern Korean society today. The day finished with a lovely Bibimbap dinner, which was shared between GDSL and KRIHS colleagues.\n\n![](photo2/a4.jpg) ![](photo2/a5.jpg) ![](photo2/a11.jpg) ![](photo2/a12.jpg)\n\n## Day 2 - KRIHS HQ, Sejong City\n\nGDSL members boarded a train to O-Song station, and were greeted by KRIHS members in official KRIHS cars to take us to their [HQ in Sejong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Korea+Research+Institute+for+Human+Settlements/@36.4915488,127.2980872,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x357b5e1ea715e2d5:0x74d0c839993eb57f!8m2!3d36.4915488!4d127.3006621!16s%2Fg%2F121tyk29?entry=ttu). Sejong is a relatively new city, which was constructed to encourage investment in the country's central region. On the way to the KRIHS HQ, we got an exciting tour of Sejong, showing how rapidly development is occurring here, and the particular emphasis on Smart City programmes.\n\nWe arrived at the HQ of KRIHS, which was something to behold, comprising incredible conferencing, co-working and meeting room facilities, rooftop views of Sejong, and even an indoor tennis court and gym for employees. We were given a full tour of the facilities, and reunited with members of KRIHS such as Myung-Hwa and Eunsun who had visited us in Liverpool the last year.\n\n![](photo2/a6.jpg) ![](photo2/a13.jpg) ![](photo2/a14.jpg) ![](photo2/a7.jpg) \n\nFollowing an introduction from KRIHS director Sangkeon Lee, we were treated to a lovely Korean lunchbox, and enjoyed conversations and discussions with KRIHS.\n\n![](photo2/a8.jpg) ![](photo2/a20.jpg)\n\nThe research exchange then commenced, with talks from GDSL members Francisco, Dani, Carmen, Cillian and Dan, as well as a series of talks from KRIHS members, and other invited talks with speakers from Inha University and the Korean National University of Transportation. The day ended with a traditional Korean dinner and GDSL members returned to Seoul.\n\nSlides for these talks can be found [in this folder](slides/)\n\n![](photo2/a15.jpg) ![](photo2/a16.jpg) ![](photo2/a17.jpg) ![](photo2/a18.jpg) ![](photo2/a19.jpg) \n\n## Day 3 - University of Seoul\n\nThe final day of the research exchange took place at the [Urban Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://ubai.uos.ac.kr/) at the University of Seoul.\n\nFollowing an opening address and tour of UBAI high performance computing infrastructure, two keynote addresses took place with one from Alex Singleton (GDSL), and another from Sangshin Park (University of Seoul).\n\n![](photo2/a22.jpg) ![](photo2/a23.jpg) ![](photo2/a24.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the day saw lightning talks from GDSL members Mark, Patrick, Ruth and Olivia, as well as KRIHS members and other invited talks with speakers from from Inha University, University of Seoul and Kyungpook National University. The day closed with a meal between GDSL and KRIHS delegates, and we bid farewell, thanking our excellent hosts for a very enjoyable week.\n\n![](photo2/a25.jpg) ![](photo2/a26.jpg) ![](photo2/a27.jpg) ![](photo2/a28.jpg) ![](photo2/a29.jpg) \n\nSlides for these talks can be found [in this folder](slides/)\n\n## Day 6 - Busan, Eco Delta Smart City \n\nAfter the weekend, the GDSL team headed to Busan with our excellent hosts Paul Jung and his wife. We visited the Eco Delta Smart City project, where we got insights into how the project was unfolding, the different 'smart' elements to it and even got a tour of a smart village, where we got to see first hand what it would be like to live in one of these communities. The day finished with a dinner between the GDSL team, Paul Jung and his wife.\n\n![](photo2/a30.jpg) ![](photo2/a31.jpg) ![](photo2/a32.jpg) ![](photo2/a33.jpg) ![](photo2/a34.jpg) ![](photo2/a36.jpg) \n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"International-Conference.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"litera","title":"International Conference: Knowledge Expansion and Exchange"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
